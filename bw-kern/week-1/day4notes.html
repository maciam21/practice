        <p>SoFi Stadium is a premier venue located in Inglewood, CA.

With top-notch performances and games night in and night out, it is one of the best places to see live entertainment and sports. Though there are other great venues in Los Angeles, SoFi Stadium may be the best of the bunch.</p>

        <h4>Consider the Following When Buying Concert Tickets</h4>
         <!-- Lorem ipsem= filler content; to access it type LOREM+Number+ENTER -->
        <p>Seats behind the stage are occassionally sold: Unless your main objective is to just get in the building, you'll want to completely avoid anything behind the stage - like those in/near or above sections Section 100, Section 101, Section 102 and Section 103. It's unlikely the performer will turn around to salute you - and you're more likely to be completely blocked out from seeing the show.</p>
        
        <p>If you're on the shorter side (or bringing kids), consider floor seats only in the first few rows: The most common complaint amongst floor ticketholders is that they can't see the stage because of taller people in front of them. As an alternative, consider side sections near the stage that will still have you close and high enough to see. </p>
        
        <p>Lower level side sections are not created equal: While the side sections closest to the stage are top-notch, side sections farther from the stage may leave you with a cramp in your neck. Sections Club 116 and Club 127 are not well-angled towards the stage - leaving you to turn your head for an ideal view. Instead, consider head-on sections in the lower level or even close side seats in the upper level like 513 and 541.</p>
